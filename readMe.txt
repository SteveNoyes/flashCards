This is a set of flashcards, questions followed by a set of choices.
Once an answer is selected the card flips over and either reveals that
the right answer was selected or no and give the right answer

or maybe a color indicator as well, your selection's font color is green if you
got it right and red if you got it wrong with the correct answer in gold, or
something like that.

the app keeps track of right and wrong answers and calculates the amount of
correct answers and returns that percentage value at the end.
